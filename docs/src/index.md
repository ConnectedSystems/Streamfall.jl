# Streamfall.jl Documentation

Streamfall: A graph-based streamflow modelling system written in [Julialang](http://julialang.org/).

Streamfall leverages the Julia language and ecosystem to support:

- Quick application and exploratory analysis
- Modelling and assessment of interacting systems
- Use of different rainfall-runoff models and their ensembles in tandem

Streamfall includes implementations of:
- GR4J
- HyMod
- IHACRES
- SYMHYD

Performance should be similar to implementations in C and Fortran.
